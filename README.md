This MATLAB code is a tool designed for students to model and analyze the kinematics and dynamics of a robotic arm. It calculates joint forces and torques, and visualizes the robot's structure. Key features include:

User Inputs: Define link masses, center of gravity, and applied forces.
DH Parameters: Set up Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for joint configuration and transformations.
Forces & Torques: Calculate joint loads and print the results.
Visualization: Display the robot's structure and joint frames in 3D.
It helps students simulate and study robotic arm behavior.
